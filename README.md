# capstone-audiolog
self-language-learning web application in the form of a diary that allows users to upload audio recordings and add their own transcription and translation.

Somehow I pushed two irrelevant files (lc101 and IntellijDemo) to this repository. I will work on remove them later. For now, please just view the "capstone" file.
